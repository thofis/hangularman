Hangularman
--------------------------------

I started this little project for learning AngularJS by using it.

The topic of the project is the famous Hangman game, where one has to guess
all character of a hidden word.

My implementation demostrates the following features of AngularJS:
- Usage of angular-seed as a starting point
- Integration of Twitter Bootstrap 3
- Integration of Angular UI (ui-bootstrap) for the modal dialog at the end
- Two way data binding for separating view from logic
- Dependency-Injection for cleanly separating different components
- Use of services, factories and values for keeping the Controller classes clean
- Asynchronous usage of $http for accessing the list of search terms


For reasons of simplicity the project doesn't have a "real" backend with a database for the search terms.
I use a static JSON-array with all countries instead.
